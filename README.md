   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MataHacks/InventorySystem.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Version control best practices should be followed closely by each developer. This includes adhering to the following guidelines:

1.	**Keep branch names concise.** Every new major fix or feature will exist in its own branch with every branch title prefixed with a one word summary of the branch changes. Branch titles should be legible, short and descriptive. For example, a correctly formatted branch title may be “feature/create-nav-menu” or “fix/fetch-api-request-error”. Branch titles may also directly reference open issues. 
2.	**Commit often.** When working within a branch, commit changes whenever a major change or adjustment has been completed. For example, if an open issue that is being worked on has multiple parts, consider committing changes following the completion of each of these parts.  
3.	**Include descriptive comments.** Before committing a change or creating a pull request make sure that descriptive comments are always included. It is especially important to tag open issues that are resolved by these changes. An example comment might look like the following,  “Fix #123 Update README file” or “Resolve #456 add missing text fields.” Details about how to include GitHub issues in your comments can be found in this discussion. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687262/link-to-the-issue-number-on-github-within-a-commit-message 
4.	**Create pull request infrequently and assign reviewers.** Only create pull request once the fix or feature described in the branch title has been completely resolved. In most cases this branch will be deleted after the pull request has been merged with the main branch. Once a pull request has been made, reviewers need to be assigned. In most cases this could include other team members familiar with or affected by these branch changes. 
5.	**Communicate while collaborating.** If more than one team member is working within a branch, each team member must actively communicate with the others to ensure that changes are pushed to their working branch whenever it makes sense for the other team members. The best time to push changes will always be on a case by case basis.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
